## Objectives
* Get all **50 stars** to save Christmas!
* Wean myself off of Python and (re)learn **C++**

Note to self: Don't push until leaderboard for challenge is full.

## Outcomes
* I failed to save **Christmas 2021** ðŸ¦‘
    - on December 25, I had only completed challenges through the first half of Day 8 (Seven Segment Search)
    - this broken commit (c5c861d) was tagged as v0.1
